# winequality


Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009 The data set are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): <br>
1 - fixed acidity<br>
2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid<br>
4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides<br>
6 - free sulfur dioxide<br>
7 - total sulfur dioxide<br>
8 - density<br>
9 - pH<br>
10 - sulphates<br>
11 - alcohol<br>
Output variable (based on sensory data):<br>
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)<br>
I am going to use those features to build a model to predict the quality score of wines.<br>
