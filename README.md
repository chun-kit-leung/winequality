# winequality


Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009 The data set are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): /n
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
I am going to use those features to build a model to predict the quality score of wines.
